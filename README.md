# Homework 06: Generating reproducible research

This assignment aimed to help us practice skills such as importing, tidying, 
transforming, visualizing, and exploring data, communicating results, applying 
basic programming principles, debugging, and carrying out defensive programming. 
We each found data that were in our own area of interests, conducted simple 
statistical analyses, and generated a report using the skills mentioned above.
